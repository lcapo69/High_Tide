              <p class="lead">The cannabis plant contains over 100 different cannabinoids, which are natural compounds that can affect the mind and body in various ways. The two most well-known cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is renowned for its psychoactive effects, which produce a sensation commonly referred to as being "high."

                On the other hand, CBD is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis, particularly in hemp varieties that are cultivated for their high CBD content. Unlike THC, CBD does not induce a "high" or psychoactive effect on its own. </p>
